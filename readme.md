Parliament - Real Talk

The Idea

Two existant problems in the house of commons proceedings are that: the front bench dominate discussion and that debate is prone to tangential sparring. 
Real Talk disrupts this paradigm. It creates a localised chat room in which anyone within the grounds of the houses of parliament can raise a topic for public discussion., be that a visitor or a back bencher MP.
Chat history is recorded and analysed to form an image of efficiency in parliament by measuring the number of times a key issue is raised, defined by the consensus data of the chatroom, in comparison with what is actually discussed.

Hurdles/Problems

This project required great reduction in scope and thus I was forced to pivot an cut much of an amibitious attempt to live track the london ambulance dispatch system.
Being incredibly new to Angular and Sockets I got bogged down in minutia without the knowledge that a configuration environment was not established. This wont happen again.
