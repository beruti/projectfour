<h3>Real Talk</h3>

<h4>The Idea</h4>

Two existant problems in the house of commons proceedings are that: the front bench dominate discussion and that debate is prone to tangential sparring. 
Real Talk disrupts this paradigm. It creates a localised chat room in which anyone within the grounds of the houses of parliament can raise a topic for public discussion., be that a visitor or a back bencher MP.
Chat history is recorded and analysed to form an image of efficiency in parliament by measuring the number of times a key issue is raised, defined by the consensus data of the chatroom, in comparison with what is actually discussed. 


<h4>Technical Requirements</h4>

Your app must:
<ul>
<li>Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own front-end</li>
<li>Have an API of your design</li>
<li>Have an interactive front-end, preferably using a modern front-end framework</li>
<li>Be a complete product, which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple models</li>
<li>Use a database, whether that's one we've covered in class or one you want to learn</li>
<li>Implement thoughtful user stories that are significant enough to help you know which features to build and which to scrap</li>
<li>Have a visually impressive design to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers</li>
<li>Be deployed online so it's publicly accessible</li>
</ul>

<h4>Technology</h4>
<ul>
<li>MEAN Stack</li>
<li>Socket.io</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Approach</h4>

Pivotal Tracker.
Pen and paper.
Many tutorials.
Basic Authentication with Angular Homework Technical Framework used.


<h4>User Stories</h4>

User can edit their username to 
User must login and out so as to have access to the app and record the data each user emits
User can delete their profile so as to remove their data from the public database
User can add contacts and notes so as to build on discussions taking place

<h4>WireFrames</h4>

<h4>Hurdles/Problems</h4>

This project required great reduction in scope and thus I was forced to pivot an cut much of an amibitious attempt to live track the london ambulance dispatch system.
Being incredibly new to Angular and Sockets I got bogged down in minutia without the knowledge that a configuration environment was not established. This wont happen again.
