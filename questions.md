what is the role attribute on a div tag?
- does it mean anything that affects the data assignment or storage
SAME thing for name attribute on form tag



What is the creation process of this app?
user story as guide
back end first - know what data you will want and its relationships ALSO know how you want people to input to it 

front end wise
html - structure
css - looks
or js - behaviour

have to have structure first and then behaviour. looks can come later

- build a registration form first in html so people will be able to use the site
OR
- build the landing page as if there is no need to register first to see this - this app is entirely about being authenticated so maybe not a very good starting point
LOOK
- to other completed example for guidance on building an app without authentication

currently the app can:
add projects
- there is no association of the projects although when you create a project you specify a user
list users
- can view a user proifle LINK by clicking on their image
cannot view a user profile
- can go to /#/profile but this leads to nothing
